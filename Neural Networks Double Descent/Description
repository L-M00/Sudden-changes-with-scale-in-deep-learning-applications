Double descent as searched for in neural networks.

The notable finding from this body of code is that neural networks are much more robust against this kind of effect.

Later work shows that double descent like effects, as well as sudden changes in generalisation behaviour, are more pronounced in neural networks than in linear models.

However, at this stage, neural networks when applied to a simple curve fitting problem are more robust.
